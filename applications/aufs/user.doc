Brief introduction to the AppleShare Unix File Server (AUFS)

Introduction

This document explains what you must do before you attempt to use Aufs
from a mac.  In addition, it explains some of the design decisions
that will affect you.

Setup

This describes the initial setup.

Create some subdirectory, let's assume it is "unix" in your top-level
directory.  This will be the repository for your MacIntosh files.
Assuming you are connected to your top level directory, type:
	"mkdir unix"

You must also create two subdirectories in this directory called
.finderinfo and .resource.  e.g. type:
	"mkdir unix/.finderinfo"
	"mkdir unix/.resource"

AppleShare has a concept of something called volumes.  Under the
MacIntosh AppleShare, each volume would be a different disk drive.
Under aufs, you are allowed to set various directories as "volumes".
Thus, you must create a file called "afpvols" or ".afpvols" (Aufs will
take "afpvols" over ".afpvols" first) in your top level (home) directory that
tells aufs what MacIntosh volumes you have.  (Yes, you may have more
than one volume).  The format of lines in this file is:
	<path>:<name to show>[:<optional password>] 
 path is the specification of the directory that will store the unix
files.  In the above example, it would be "~/unix".  <name to show> is
the name the AppleShare client will show when it asks you which volume
to mount.  The <optional password>, if set, is used when you attempt
to mount the volume.  You probably don't want it - it is included for
system volumes.

We should note that ~/unix should be considered a "MacIntosh" volume
and you should be very careful about changes you make to it with unix
utilities.  (If you're not sure, do a "Get Info" from the Finder on
the Folder/Volume) In generally, it's better to move things around,
delete things, etc. using the Mac AppleShare client.


Structure

o How MacIntosh files are stored

MacIntosh Operating System files have two parts known as the data and
resource "fork" (these forks have nothing to do with processes, etc).
Suffice it to say, that data is usually stored in the data fork and
programs and associated resources in the resources fork.  In addition,
there is also an "information" fork which keeps information like the
file creator, file type, and location on the desktop, etc.

However, Unix doesn't expect a file to be of more than one part.  So,
to get around this, we store a MacIntosh file in a particular
directory as follows.  Each directory that stores MacIntosh files will
have a ".finderinfo" and ".resource" subdirectory created.  The file
information and resource forks of a file are stored in the respective
subdirectories while the data fork is stored in the directory.  For
example, given the MacIntosh file "MacWrite" stored in the directory
"macfiles", the listing of the directory would be as follows:
	mac/MacWrite
	mac/.resource/MacWrite
	mac/.finderinfo/MacWrite

Normally, you will find it more difficult to use or see the resource
or finder information files; however, since the data in those files are
really very specific to the MacIntosh, this shouldn't pose a great
problem.

There is one more peculiar thing that happens.  Directories need to
have "finder information" stored.  Well, a directory is treated almost
the same as a file - we simply store the finder information in the
.finderinfo subdirectory of the containing directory.  No resource
file/fork is created though.  For example, suppose we create the
directory "paints" in the directory "mac", then the structure would
look like:
	mac/paints		<- a directory
	mac/.finderinfo/paints	<- finder infomation file

To obfusctiate the issue even more, we should note that the directory
paints also has ".finderinfo" and ".resource" forks.


o How Unix files and directories are treated

Unix directories are directories without a .finderinfo or .resource
subdirectory.  The main things to know here are:
  o you cannot copy a macintosh file with a resource fork to a
    directory without a .resource subdirectory.
  o "New Folder" will create a new directory.  It will have a
    .finderinfo or .resource directory if the superior directory does.

Unix-only files are essentially files with only a data fork.
Following are some notes about them.
 - Unix files used to come up locked, THEY NO LONGER DO.
 - Unix files come up with creator "unix" and type "TEXT" by default.
 - Unix files use line feed (lf) as a line terminator while the
   Macintosh Operating System uses carriage returns (cr) - this can
   cause problems.  To work around this, if a file has creator "unix"
   and type "TEXT", then lf's are mapped to cr's on reads and vice
   versa on writes.  The way to stop this is to set the file's creator
   or type to something else using DiskTop, ResEdit or whatever (note,
   if it is a file in a directory without a .finderinfo directory,
   then the modified file creator/type may reset to unix/TEXT at any
   time).
 - In the same vein, anytime "line at a time" reads with "cr"
   (mac line terminator) as the end of line terminator are done, then
   both "cr" and "lf" are used as end of line terminators regardless
   of the file creator and type.   An example of a program that does
   this is BinHex.
 - Copying a Unix file to or rewriting a Unix file in a directory
   with .resource and .finderinfo subdirectories will cause the
   resultant  file to be a MacIntosh file. 
 - The Finder really needs to be able to store the finderinfo to work
   efficiently.  If you have a unix directory that you plan to
   manipulate a lot, then you can speed up things a lot by creating a
   .finderinfo subdirectory - however, remember this will cause Aufs
   to create a .finderinfo file for each file in the directory.

o Volumes

As we noted before, volumes on a MacIntosh AppleShare server
correspond to disk drives and on under Aufs they correspond to
directories listed in the afpvols file.

If the top level directory of an Aufs volume has a .finderinfo
subdirectory, Aufs assumes that the volume will primarily be used for
Macintosh files.  In this case, it will create two files in that
directory called: .ADeskTop and .IDeskTop.  The two files correspond
to the "DeskTop" file on the MacIntosh and are seperated for efficency
reasons.

The .IDeskTop file maintains a database of the icons.  The .ADeskTop
file records the file creator to application mappings - basically, it
tells what application to launch when you double click on a document
with that file creator.  Like the Desktop on the Macintosh, neither of
these files shrink.  Unlike the Desktop on the Macintosh, if you want
to rebuild the desktop with only entries on the volume, you must first
remove these files.

You can have volumes in your afpvols file that overlap.  You should be
careful about operation between the two volumes when mounted at the
same time.

o Other notes

Unix distinguishes case when opening and getting information about
files.  The MacIntosh Operating System doesn't.  This will cause
problems with some applications (such as MPW).

The specification for the Appletalk Filing Protocol used by AppleShare
and AUFS and the specification for the Hierachial File System used by
MacIntoshes state that directory ids are fixed across the lifetime of
a volume.  In addition, directory ids are not reused.  Unfortunately,
aufs breaks this rule.  Directory ids are unique only for a particular
session.  Some programs and packages store away directory ids and you
may see some unexpected things happening (but it shoudn't be anything
bad).
